# OpenGIN Ingestion UI

This document describes how to install, build, and serve the OpenGIN Ingestion UI.

## File Structure

-   **Frontend**: `python/ui` (Next.js application)
-   **Backend**: `python/src/opengin/server` (FastAPI application)

## Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: v18 or later.
-   **Python**: v3.11 or later (with `mamba` or `conda` recommended).

## Installation

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)

Navigate to the UI directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd python/ui
npm install
```

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)

Ensure you have the `doctracer` environment or equivalent set up.

```bash
# If using mamba/conda
mamba activate doctracer
pip install -e ".[tracer]"  # Install opengin with tracer dependencies

```

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

### Backend

```bash
# From the project root
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:python/src
uvicorn opengin.server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd python/ui
npm run dev -- -p 3001 
```

The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Production Build

To build the frontend for production:

```bash
cd python/ui
npm run build
npm start
```

This will run the optimized production server.

## Cleanup

The application generates temporary files and extraction artifacts in the following directories (relative to the directory where the backend server is started):

*   `sandbox/uploads`: Contains uploaded PDF files.
*   `sandbox/pipelines`: Contains extraction results, metadata, and intermediate files.

These directories can grow over time. You can safely remove them to free up disk space if the extraction history is no longer needed:

```bash
rm -rf sandbox/uploads
rm -rf sandbox/pipelines
```
